Welcome to the **trustworthy-AI pipeline** (twai) project!

The project aims to support AI practitioners, data scientists, and engineers who are interested in implementing trustworthy AI systems under the European AI Act. It provides engineering practices and background information to accelerate compliance with the regulations for high-risk systems.

If you want to dive straight into code, we provide a showcase project containing a worked end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a (hypothetical) high-risk AI system.

As a first time visitor, have a look at the [Reader's Guide](readers-guide/index.md) for navigating the content.
