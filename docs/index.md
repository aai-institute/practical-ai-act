**This guide brings together EU AI Act requirements with practical engineering solutions.**

New to the AI Act? Start with our [comprehensive introduction](https://www.appliedai-institute.de/ai-act) to understand the regulatory landscape.


**What you'll find here:**

 - AI Act requirements decoded for technical teams
 - Working code examples demonstrating compliance in practice
 - Engineering practices that build trustworthy AI systems
 - Clear connections between legal obligations and technical implementation

*To ensure compliance, trust must be built into the engineering process of AI systems.* This guide demonstrates how modern MLOps practices provide a strong foundation for meeting regulatory requirements while building robust, trustworthy AI solutions.

This is a living resource that will be continuously updated as more legal and technical information becomes available. Your feedback and discussions are highly encouraged to help us refine the content and ensure its relevance to the community.

        The <strong>Bavarian AI Innovation Accelerator</strong> is a two-year project funded by the Bavarian State Ministry for Digital Affairs to support SMEs, startups, and the public sector in Bavaria in complying with the EU AI Act. Led by the appliedAI Institute for Europe and in collaboration with Ludwig Maximilian University, Technical University of Munich, and Technical University of Nuremberg, the project offers training, resources, and events. The project goals include reducing compliance costs, shortening time to compliance, and strengthening AI innovation.
