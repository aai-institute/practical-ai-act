# Robustness

### **Robust Model Design**

- **Regularization Techniques:** Apply L1/L2 regularization or dropout to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combine predictions from multiple models to improve robustness against errors in individual models. Know when certain models in the ensemble are not suitable.
- **Adversarial Training:** Train the model on adversarial examples to enhance its resilience to malicious inputs.

### **Testing**

- **Boundary Testing:** Test the AI system with inputs near decision boundaries to evaluate its behavior under edge cases.
- **Scenario-Based Testing:** Simulate real-world scenarios, including extreme conditions, to assess system stability.

### **Monitoring and Feedback Loops**

- **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the AI systemâ€™s performance in production to detect deviations or degradation over time.
- **Feedback Mechanisms:** Implement systems that allow end-users to report issues or anomalies.

### **Model Updating and Retraining**

- **Continuous Learning:** Periodically retrain the model with updated data to adapt to changes in the operating environment.
- **Version Control:** Maintain and document model versions, including performance evaluations for each update.
