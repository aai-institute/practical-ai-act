# Interoperability

- Where applicable, ensure that datasets and documentation are interoperable with standard regulatory frameworks and can be audited by authorities.
    - Standardize formats (e.g., CSV or Parquet files for tabular data)
    - Centralize data storage (e.g., in a data lake or data warehouse) such that access to data sets can be given at any time, and it is not depending on data sets on local machines of ML Engineers and Data Scientists.
