# Record-Keeping (Article 12)

|Article 12| of the AI Act sets out requirements for record-keeping by providers of high-risk AI systems.

|Article 13(3)| lays out additional requirements for remote biometrics identification systems as defined in |Annex III, point 1(a)|, which are out of scope for this document.

## What is record-keeping?

Record-keeping is the practice of keeping records of events (logs) of an AI system throughout its lifetime.
This includes the automatic collection, storage, and processing of appropriate data that is relevant to the intended purpose of the AI system.

At the very least, a compliant record-keeping system should capture logging data that allows:

- Identification of situations that may result in the system presenting a **risk** within the meaning of |Art. 79(1)|
- Identification of situations that may lead to a **substantial modification** of the AI system
- [**Post-market monitoring**](#post-market-monitoring) of the AI system as defined in |Article 72|
- [**Monitoring**](#monitoring-of-operations) of the AI system's operation by the deployer, as defined in |Article 26(5)|.

## Post-Market Monitoring

## Monitoring of Operations

## Next Steps

- Define and document logging architecture
  - Reliability (long-term storage, backups, ...)
  - Scalability
  - Privacy requirements? (e.g., when working with personal data under GDPR)
