# Privacy and data security

- Use anonymization or pseudonymization techniques where personal data is involved
    - **Masking:** Replace sensitive information with placeholder characters or symbols.
    - **Generalization:** Replace specific data values with more general ones to reduce specificity.
    - **Suppression:** Remove sensitive data fields entirely or omit certain records to ensure privacy.
    - **Pseudonymization:** Replace identifiable information with pseudonyms or tokens.
    - **Noise:** Add random noise to numerical data to obscure exact values while preserving overall patterns.
    - **Differential Privacy:** Introduce carefully calibrated noise to data or query results to ensure privacy guarantees (Laplace)
    
- Protect datasets against unauthorized access, breaches, and other security risks.
