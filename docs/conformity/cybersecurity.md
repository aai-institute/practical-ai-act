### **Data Protection**

- **Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Anonymization and Pseudonymization:** Remove or mask sensitive data used in the AI system.

### **Authentication and Access Control**

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Restrict system access based on user roles.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for system access to enhance security.
- **Audit Logging:** Record and monitor access to sensitive system components and data.

### **Secure Deployment**

- **Containerization:** Deploy AI systems in secure containers and isolate them from external systems.
- **Runtime Monitoring:** Use runtime security tools to monitor and block malicious activities during operation.
