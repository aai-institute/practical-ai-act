!!! warning "TODO"

    Out of scope:

    - legal advice
    - all-encompassing reference architecture
    - LLMs
    - GPAI-specific requirements under Chapter V (roadmap?), maybe link to AI Office [Code of Practice](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-code-practice)
    - machine learning theory and best practice (algorithm and software design), link beyond jupyter?
