Describe what this project is all about

## Who is this website for?

This project is intended for AI practitioners, data scientists, and engineers who are interested in implementing trustworthy AI systems under the European AI Act.

The information is applicable to low- and high-risk AI systems, since it provides a sound engineering foundation for building trustworthy AI systems in general.

## Who is it not for?

If you are building a general-purpose AI system, you will still find the engineering resources useful, since they mirror good software engineering practices.

However, the compliance resources are specifically tailored to the requirements for high-risk AI systems under Chapter III of the AI Act.

For guidance on how to comply with Chapter V of the AI Act, you might find the following resources helpful:

-   The [European AI Office](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-office), which oversees the implementation of the AI Act, while ensuring compliance, fostering innovation, and coordinating AI governance across EU Member States.
-   The [General-Purpose AI Code of Practice](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-code-practice), and an [explorer for the draft Code of Practice](https://code-of-practice.ai).

## Recommended Knowledge

-   A basic understanding of machine learning and AI concepts
-   Familiarity with Python programming
-   An understanding of the terminology in |Art. 3| of the AI Act
-   Software engineering best practices for ML:
    -   See the [Beyond Jupyter series](https://transferlab.ai/trainings/beyond-jupyter/) for an introduction

!!! warning "TODO"

    Out of scope:

    - ☑️ legal advice
    - all-encompassing reference architecture
    - LLMs
    - ☑️ GPAI-specific requirements under Chapter V (roadmap?), maybe link to AI Office [Code of Practice](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-code-practice)
    - machine learning theory and best practice (algorithm and software design), link beyond jupyter?
