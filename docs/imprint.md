## Liability for contents

The contents of our pages were created with the greatest care. However, we cannot assume any liability for the correctness, completeness and topicality of the contents. In accordance with legal regulations, we are also responsible for our own content on these web pages. In this context, we would like to point out that we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Our obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with the general laws remain unaffected by this in accordance with §§ 8 to 10 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG).

## Liability for links
The operators of external links (to third-party websites) are solely responsible for their content. At the time of linking, we were not aware of any violations. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove the corresponding link immediately.

## Copyright
Our web pages and their contents are subject to German copyright law. Any form of exploitation, reproduction or editing of copyrighted works on our websites requires the prior consent of the respective copyright holder, unless expressly permitted by law. Individual reproductions of a work are permitted for private use only. The materials on these pages are copyrighted and any unauthorized use may violate copyright laws.

## Compliance

Compliance or adherence to rules is more complex today than ever before. In the global environment, the legal challenges are constantly growing. That is why we are continuously adapting our processes and systems to the legal framework.

To detect potential misconduct or breaches of laws and regulations at an early stage, we have introduced the option to report indications of possible compliance violations.

A compliance violation occurs when (i) our employees violate applicable laws or internal policies in the course of their work in Germany or abroad or (ii) in case of violations against our employees. Such violations include, for example, corruption offenses, competition and antitrust offenses, data protection offenses and offenses in accounting, finance and tax matters.

To detect and prevent compliance violations, we rely on our employees as well as our customers and business partners.

If you notice signs of a compliance violation, you can report them through various channels.

Whichever way you choose, we assure you that every report will be treated in strict confidence - anonymously if you wish - within the framework of applicable laws.

### Compliance Officer

If you would like to report indications of compliance violations or have questions on the subject of compliance, please contact our Compliance Officer:
